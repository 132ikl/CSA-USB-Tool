# CSA-USB-Tool
Tool to download all files in a given FIRST season needed to support teams.

This tool downloads all the installers/packages for a given FRC season. CSA's commonly need these on hand in a USB to help
teams update to the latest version or to diagnose issues.

It also has the capability to build an ISO image for all these files for fast burning onto USB's via ISOtoUSB
